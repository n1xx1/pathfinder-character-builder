            "description": "You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.\n\nFocus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300.\n\nYou learn the *counter performance* composition spell (page 386), protecting against auditory and visual effects.\n\n### Composition Cantrips\n\nComposition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining (page 481). You learn the *inspire courage* composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.  \n"

You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.\n\nEach day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\nAs you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3\u20136: Bard Spells per Day on page 98.\n\nSome of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447. \n\n### Heightening Spells\n\nWhen you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (page 299). The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n### Cantrips\n\nSome of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, which equals the highest level of spell you can cast as a bard. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.  \n"

At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list (page 311) or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.\n\nYou add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3\u20136), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\nThough you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. \n\n### Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire\n\nAs you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime (page 481).  \n"

While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne'erdo- well and a jack-of-all-trades, it's dangerous to dismiss you as a master of none.*\n\n## During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed.  \n\n## During Social Encounters...\n\nYou persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease.  \n\n## While Exploring...\n\nYou're a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context and helpful reconnaissance for the group's adventure. Your spells and performances inspire your allies to greater discovery and success.  \n\n## In Downtime...\n\nYou can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college.  \n\n## You Might...\n\n* Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it. \n* Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required. \n* Follow your muse, whether it's a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret lore that few others have.\n\n## Others Probably...\n\n* Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles. \n* Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic. \n* Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of your beguiling magic.\n\n"
