Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.*\n\n## During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them. You target and brutalize your chosen foe with either a bow or melee weapons, while supporting your allies with your skills.  \n\n## During Social Encounters...\n\nWhen you speak, it's with the voice of practical experience, especially involving wilderness exploration.  \n\n## While Exploring...\n\nYou guide your allies through the wilderness or follow tracks. You keep an eye out for trouble, constantly alert for danger even when it's not overt.  \n\n## In Downtime...\n\nYou craft weapons and snares in preparation for your next venture. If you prefer to get outside, you might go on hunts or scout nearby areas to better understand your environment.  \n\n## You Might...\n\n* Respect the raw power of nature and understand how to make the best of its bounty. \n* Enjoy the thrill of the hunt. \n* Scout out ahead of the party, reconnoitering dangers before combat begins.\n\n## Others Probably...\n\n* Call upon you to protect them from the wilds or the encroachment of civilization. \n* Expect you to be a quiet or taciturn loner. \n* Think there is something dangerous and wild about you.\n\n"
