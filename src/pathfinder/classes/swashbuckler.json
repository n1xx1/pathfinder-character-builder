At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).\n\nWhile you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache.

You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.*\n\n## During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.  \n\n## During Social Encounters...\n\nYou are equally likely to charm or intimidate others\u2014or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.  \n\n## While Exploring...\n\nYou keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.  \n\n## In Downtime...\n\nYou might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers.  \n\n## You Might...\n\n* Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present.\n* Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.\n* Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.\n\n## Others Probably...\n\n* Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.\n* Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style.\n* Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.\n\n"
