            "description": "You understand the complex interactions of natural and unnatural substances and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.\n\nYou gain the Alchemical Crafting feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. The catalog of alchemical items begins on page 543. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.\n\n### Infused Reagents\n\nYou infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.\n\nAs soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.\n\n### Advanced Alchemy\n\nDuring your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.\n\n### Quick Alchemy\n\nIf you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.\n\n### Quick Alchemy :a:\n\n; Alchemist, Manipulate  \n**Source** *Core Rulebook pg. 72* <sup>1.1</sup>  \n**Cost** 1 batch of infused reagents  \n**Requirements** You have alchemist's tools, the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and a free hand.\n\n---\n\nYou swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.    \n"

The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. The catalog of alchemical items begins on page 543.\n\nEach time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the Inventor feat.\n\n### Sample Formula Book\n\nYou can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas. A beginner's book with these formulas called *The Fundamentals of Alchemy* has become popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling alchemists away from more innovative experiments.\n\n**Alchemical Item Formulas**: Lesser acid flask, lesser alchemist's fire, lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, lesser cheetah's elixir, lesser elixir of life, lesser tanglefoot bag, lesser smokestick.  \n"

You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.*\n\n## During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. At higher levels, your mutagens warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon.  \n\n## During Social Encounters...\n\nYou provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases.  \n\n## While Exploring...\n\nYou keep an eye out for trouble with your bombs at the ready, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious.  \n\n## In Downtime...\n\nYou experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge.  \n\n## You Might...\n\n* Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause. \n* Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt. \n* Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.\n\n## Others Probably...\n\n* Think you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you don't cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception. \n* Don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention. \n* Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will.\n\n"
