While evil characters in general can range from self-serving but loyal allies to the extremes of depravity, evil champions are particularly vile, with a code that requires, enforces, and depends upon their villainous behavior. This means they can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be accessible player character options only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. The tenets and causes of evil are uncommon options. While the feats and actions suitable for evil champions don't separately list access entries, typically if your GM grants you access to evil tenets, you also gain access to champion actions and feats that require those tenets.* You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit a purely good act, such as giving something solely out of charity, casting a good spell, or using a good item.\n* You must never put another person's needs before your own, and you must never put your own needs before those of your deity. Though you can perform acts others might consider helpful, it must be done with the expectation that it ultimately furthers your own goals or those of your master.\n\n"

Deities often add additional strictures (for instance, Torag's champions can't show mercy to enemies of their people, making it almost impossible for them to follow the redeemer cause). Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you're hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.\n\nIf you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an *atone* ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don't require those class features. If your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still following the same deity.\n\nTenets can be found here.  \n"

You gain the Destructive Vengeance champion's reaction and the *touch of corruption* devotion spell. After the tenets of evil, add these tenets. * You must not bind yourself with any law or oath beyond that of your code (though you can still select a champion feat with the oath trait). Act dishonorably, take advantage of others, lie, cheat, and steal to get what you want.\n* You must destroy that which offends you and that which stands in your way, including\u2014and perhaps especially\u2014the forces of good and law that oppose you. This tenet doesn't force you to take action immediately if it could mean your destruction, nor does it require you to destroy something that might be useful if corrupted toward your ends.\n\n## Champion's Reaction\n\n### Destructive Vengeance :r:\n\n; Uncommon, Champion  \n**Source** *Advanced Player's Guide pg. 117*  \n**Trigger** An enemy within 15 feet damages you.\n\n---\n\nBloodshed begets bloodshed as you drag your enemy toward oblivion. You increase the amount of damage you take by 1d6, and you deal 1d6 damage to the triggering enemy, choosing evil or negative damage to deal to the enemy each time you use this reaction. In addition, until the end of your next turn, your Strikes against the triggering creature deal 2 extra damage of the type you chose.\n\nThe damage you take and deal when you use this reaction increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 9th level, 4d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6 at 19th level. The extra damage on your Strikes increases to 4 at 9th level and 6 at 16th level.\n\n## Divine Smite -- Level 9\n\nAn enemy damaged by the initial damage from your Destructive Vengeance also takes persistent evil damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This applies only to the damage the reaction itself deals to the triggering creature, not the damage you deal with subsequent Strikes.\n\n## Exalt -- Level 11\n\nWhen you use Destructive Vengeance, each enemy within 15 feet of you other than the triggering creature takes half the damage you deal to the triggering enemy, of the same damage type you chose."
