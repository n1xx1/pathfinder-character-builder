            "description": "Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302).\n\nAt 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\nAs you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3\u201319: Wizard Spells per Day on page 205.\n\nSome of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447. \n\n### Heightening Spells\n\nWhen you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. \n\n### Cantrips\n\nA cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up\u2014this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. \n\n### Spellbook\n\nEvery arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page 291), which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list from this book (page 307) or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like *The Crimson Libram*, or something more academic, like *A Field Study in Practical Transmutation*.\n\nEach time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures, as described on page 241.\n\n### Sample Spellbook\n\nYou can fill your spellbook with whichever spells you like, but the list below covers a good selection of starter spells for a 1st-level wizard. These are the exact spells found in *Structure and Interpretation of Arcane Magic*, a basic spellbook used by arcane academies and master wizards to teach apprentices good habits in arcane research. \n\n**Cantrips**: *Acid splash*, *detect magic*, *electric arc*, *light*, *mage hand*, *message*, *prestidigitation*, *ray of frost*, *read aura*, and *shield*. \n\n**1st Level**: *Burning hands*, *color spray*, *grease*, *mage armor*, and *magic missile*, plus one spell of your school if you're a specialist wizard.  \n"

Your familiar gains an extra ability, and it gains an additional extra ability when you reach 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. Your connection with your familiar alters your arcane bond class feature so that you store your magical energy in your familiar, rather than an item you own; you also gain the Drain Familiar free action instead of Drain Bonded Item. Drain Familiar can be used any time an ability would allow you to use Drain Bonded Item and functions identically, except that you draw magic from your familiar instead of an item."

It contains one cantrip and one 1st-level spell, both from your spellbook, but it gains no charges normally during your preparations; you must expend a spell slot to grant it charges in the same way you would add additional charges to a normal staff. You can Craft your makeshift staff into any other type of staff for the new staff's usual cost, adding the two spells you originally chose to the staff you Craft.\n\nAt 8th level, you can expend two spells instead of one when preparing your staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined levels of the expended spells. At 16th level, you can expend up to a total of three spells to add charges to the staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined levels of all three spells."

You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient esoteric tomes to discover and understand how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and there's no way you can study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic, gaining deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all others, or favor a broader approach that emphasizes the way all magic comes together at the expense of depth.*\n\n## During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like *invisibility* or *flight*, you answer with spells like *glitterdust* or *earth bind*, leveling the field for your allies.\n\n## During Social Encounters...\n\nYou provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic.\n\n## While Exploring...\n\nYou locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome.\n\n## In Downtime...\n\nYou learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own.\n\n## You Might...\n\n* Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works\u2014magic in particular. \n* Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you're a specialist) or that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you're a universalist). \n* Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people.\n\n## Others Probably...\n\n* Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous. \n* Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it's too late. \n* Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.\n\n"
