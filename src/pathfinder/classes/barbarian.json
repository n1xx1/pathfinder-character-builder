The specific attack gained, the damage it deals, and its traits are listed on Table 3\u20133: Animal Instincts. These attacks are in the brawling group. Your Rage action gains the morph, primal, and transmutation traits.\n\n## Specialization Ability\n\nIncrease the damage die size for the unarmed attacks granted by your chosen animal by one step, and increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 5 for your chosen animal's unarmed attacks. The frog's tongue attack and deer's antler attack gain reach 10 feet. If you have greater weapon specialization, increase the damage from Rage from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal's unarmed attacks.\n\n## Raging Resistance\n\nYou resist piercing and slashing damage."

Whether you're a member of a superstitious family or culture that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant battle against wizards and witches, a survivor of a magical accident that instilled an intense aversion in your mind and body, or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic. This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of magical arts. Your extremely restrictive anathema grants you powers beyond those of other instincts.\n\n## Anathema\n\nWillingly accepting the effects of magic spells (including from scrolls, wands, and the like), even from your allies, is anathema to your instinct. You can still drink potions and invest and activate most magic items you find, though items that cast spells are subject to the same restrictions as all other spells. If an ally insists on using magic on you despite your unwillingness, and you have no reason to believe they will stop, continuing to travel with that ally of your own free will counts as willingly accepting their spells (as do similar circumstances) and thus is also anathema to your instinct.\n\n## Superstitious Resilience (Instinct Ability)\n\nWhile raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to all saves against magic. Increase your damage from Rage from 2 to 4 against creatures that can cast spells. Once every 10 minutes, when you Rage, you regain Hit Points equal to the temporary Hit Points you gain from that Rage action.\n\n## Specialization Ability\n\nIncrease the damage from Rage from 4 to 8 against creatures that can cast spells. If you have greater raging specialization, instead increase the damage from Rage to 12 against creatures with spells and 8 against other creatures.\n\n## Raging Resistance\n\nChoose two associated magical traditions: arcane and occult, arcane and primal, divine and occult, or divine and primal. The resistance from your raging resistance class feature applies against all damage you take from spells cast with these two traditions of magic, regardless of the type of damage dealt by the spell."

You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most.*\n\n## During Combat Encounters...\n\nYou summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through. Offense is your best defense\u2014you'll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses.  \n\n## During Social Encounters...\n\nYou use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can't get the job done.  \n\n## While Exploring...\n\nYou look out for danger, ready to rush headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water's surface. If something needs breaking, you're up to the task!  \n\n## In Downtime...\n\nYou might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.  \n\n## You Might...\n\n* Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration. \n* Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium. \n* Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness\u2014and punch anyone who says this conflicts with your distaste for patience and tedium.\n\n## Others Probably...\n\n* Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight. \n* See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society. \n* Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done.\n\n"
