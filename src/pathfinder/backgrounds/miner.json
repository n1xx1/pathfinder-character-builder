    "description": "You earned a living wrenching precious minerals from the lightless depths of the earth. Adventuring might have seemed lucrative or glamorous compared to this backbreaking labor\u2014 and if you have to head back underground, this time you plan to do so armed with a real weapon instead of a miner's pick.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Survival skill, and the Mining Lore skill. You gain the Terrain Expertise skill feat with underground terrain."
