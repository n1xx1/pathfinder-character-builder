However you left the guard, you might think of adventuring as a way to use your skills on a wider stage.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Intimidation skill, and the Legal Lore skill or Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Quick Coercion skill feat."
