You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.\n\nChoose one ability boost. It must be **Strength**, **Dexterity**, or **Constitution**.\n\nYou are trained in Nature and Survival. You gain low-light vision (or darkvision if you already had low-light vision), imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet, and the Forager skill feat.  "
