    "description": "In a dusty shop, market stall, or merchant caravan, you bartered wares for coin and trade goods. The skills you picked up still apply in the adventuring life, in which a good deal on a suit of armor could prevent your death.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Diplomacy skill, and the Mercantile Lore skill. You gain the Bargain Hunter skill feat."
