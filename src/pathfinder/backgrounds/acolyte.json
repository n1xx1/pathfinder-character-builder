You may have traveled out into the world to spread the message of your religion or because you cast away the teachings of your faith, but deep down you'll always carry within you the lessons you learned.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Religion skill, and the Scribing Lore skill. You gain the Student of the Canon skill feat."
