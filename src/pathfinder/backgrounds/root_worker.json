Taking up with adventurers has given you company on the road, as well as protection from those who would brand you a fake\u2014or worse.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Occultism skill, and the Herbalism Lore skill. You gain the Root Magic skill feat."
