Your dogged commitment to deliver your message was good training for the life of an adventurer.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Society skill, and a Lore skill for the city in which you were raised. You gain the Glean Contents skill feat."
