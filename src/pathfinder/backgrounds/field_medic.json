You patched up soldiers, guards, or other combatants, and learned a fair amount about the logistics of war.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Medicine skill, and the Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Battle Medicine skill feat."
