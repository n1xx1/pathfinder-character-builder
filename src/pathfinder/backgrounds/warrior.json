    "description": "In your younger days, you waded into battle as a mercenary, a warrior defending a nomadic people, or a member of a militia or army. You might have wanted to break out from the regimented structure of these forces, or you could have always been as independent a warrior as you are now.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Intimidation skill, and the Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Intimidating Glare skill feat."
