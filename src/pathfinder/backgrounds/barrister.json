You're capable of mounting a prosecution or defense in court, and you tend to keep abreast of local laws, as you never can tell when you might need to know them on short notice.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Diplomacy skill, and the Legal Lore skill. You gain the Group Impression skill feat."
