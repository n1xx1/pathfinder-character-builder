    "description": "The thrill of the win drew you into games of chance. This might have been a lucrative sideline that paled in comparison to the real risks of adventuring, or you might have fallen on hard times due to your gambling and pursued adventuring as a way out of a spiral.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Deception skill, and the Games Lore skill. You gain the Lie to Me skill feat."
