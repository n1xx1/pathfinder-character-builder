You might have been a blacksmith's apprentice toiling over the forge for countless hours, a young tailor sewing garments of all kinds, or a shipwright shaping the hulls of ships.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Crafting skill, and the Guild Lore skill. You gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat."
