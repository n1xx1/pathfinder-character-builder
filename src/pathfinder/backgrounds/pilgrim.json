    "description": "In your youth, you made several pilgrimages to important shrines and holy sites. You might have been a mendicant friar, a seller of holy relics (real or fraudulent), or just a simple farmer following the dictates of your faith. Whatever the aims of your wanderings now, your faith still protects you on the road.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Religion skill, and a Lore skill for your patron deity. You gain the Pilgrim's Token skill feat."
