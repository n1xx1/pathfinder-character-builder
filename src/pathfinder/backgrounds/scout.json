    "description": "You called the wilderness home as you found trails and guided travelers. Your wanderlust could have called you to the adventuring life, or perhaps you served as a scout for soldiers and found you liked battle.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Survival skill, and a Lore skill related to one terrain you scouted in (such as Forest Lore or Cavern Lore). You gain the Forager skill feat."
