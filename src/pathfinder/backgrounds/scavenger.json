    "description": "You've made a living sorting through the things society throws away. You might have scavenged simply to survive, or plied a trade as a ragpicker, dung carter, or the like. While you've left that life behind, you still keep one eye on the ground out of habit.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Survival skill, and a Lore skill for the settlement you grew up scavenging in. You gain the Forager skill feat."
