    "description": "You eked out a living by picking pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you'd find your next meal. While some folk adventure for the glory, you do so to survive.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Thievery skill, and a Lore skill for the city you lived in as a street urchin (such as Absalom Lore or Magnimar Lore). You gain the Pickpocket skill feat."
