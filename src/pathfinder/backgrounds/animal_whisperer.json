    "description": "You have always felt a connection to animals, and it was only a small leap to learn to train them. As you travel, you continuously encounter different creatures, befriending them along the way.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Nature skill, and a Lore skill related to one terrain inhabited by animals you like (such as Plains Lore or Swamp Lore). You gain the Train Animal skill feat."
