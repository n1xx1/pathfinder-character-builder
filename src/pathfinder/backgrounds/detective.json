You might have become an adventurer as part of your next big mystery, but likely it was due to the consequences or aftermath of a prior case.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Society skill, and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the Streetwise skill feat."
