    "description": "In an isolated place\u2014like a cave, remote oasis, or secluded mansion\u2014you lived a life of solitude. Adventuring might represent your first foray out among other people in some time. This might be a welcome reprieve from solitude or an unwanted change, but in either case, you're likely still rough around the edges.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in your choice of either the Nature or Occultism skill, as well as a Lore skill related to the terrain you lived in as a hermit (such as Cave Lore or Desert Lore). You gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat."
