Perhaps you signed onto a merchant's vessel, joined the navy, or even fell in with a crew of pirates and scalawags.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Athletics skill, and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the Underwater Marauder skill feat."
