    "description": "In your youth, you galloped on horseback over vast prairies, serving as a vanguard for your settlement, an army, or another group. Seeing so many different lands built a thirst in you to adventure and explore the world instead of just racing past it.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Nature skill, and the Plains Lore skill. You gain the Express Rider skill feat."
