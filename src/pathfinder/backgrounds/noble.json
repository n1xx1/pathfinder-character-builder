Whether you seek to escape your duties by adventuring or to better your station, you have traded silks and pageantry for an adventurer's life.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Society skill, and the Genealogy Lore skill or Heraldry Lore skill. You gain the Courtly Graces skill feat."
