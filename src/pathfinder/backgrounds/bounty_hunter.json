Your techniques for hunting down criminals transfer easily to the life of an adventurer.\n\nChoose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.\n\nYou're trained in the Survival skill, and the Legal Lore skill. You gain the Experienced Tracker skill feat."
