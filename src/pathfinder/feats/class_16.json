This involves moving about the area and studying footprints, the placement of objects, spilled drinks or blood, and so forth. You get an indistinct mental impression of significant events that happened there. This gives you clues and details of the past, including the overall events and their time frame, but it's not a perfect record. This also isn't enough to identify who was involved in these events if you weren't already aware the person was there. As determined by the GM, you also pick out various seemingly small details that could serve as important clues, like a memorable weapon someone used for a murder or the type of cloak someone wore when passing through."

After casting a spell on only yourself that offers several choices of effect (such as *resist energy*, *spell immunity*, or a polymorph spell that offers several potential forms), you can alter the choice you made when Casting the Spell (for instance, choosing a different type of damage for *resist energy*). However, your tinkering weakens the spell's integrity, reducing its remaining duration by half.\n\nYou can't use this feat if the benefits of the spell have already been used up or if the effects of the first choice would persist in any way after switching (for instance, if one of the choices was to create a consumable item you already used, or to heal you), or if the feat would create an effect more powerful than that offered by the base spell. The GM is the final arbiter of what Spell Tinker can be applied to."
